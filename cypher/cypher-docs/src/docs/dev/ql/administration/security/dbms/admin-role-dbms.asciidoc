As <<administration-security-administration-introduction, described above>>, the `admin` role has a number of built-in privileges that cannot be assigned using Cypher commands.
These include:

* Create or drop databases
* Change configuration parameters
* Manage transactions
* Manage users and roles
* Manage sub-graph privileges
* Manage procedure security

The easiest way to enable a user to perform these tasks is to grant them the `admin` role.
Only a subset of these privileges are assignable using Cypher commands: <<administration-security-administration-dbms-privileges-role-management, role management>> and <<administration-security-administration-dbms-privileges-user-management, user management>>.
However, it is possible to make a custom role with a subset of these privileges.
